Build a heart disease failure prediction project using ANN and Lazyclassifier library.
Taken the dataset from kaggle . Link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data/data
All the attributes are important.so, taken all atributes in consideration.
Applied lazyclassifier and ANN in that dataset.
Randomforest outperforms all model by big margin and gave 90 percent accuracy.
ANN gives 82% accuracy with good F1 score.
